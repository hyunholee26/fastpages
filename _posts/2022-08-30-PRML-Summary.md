## 1.2 Probability Theory

- The probability that $X$ will take the value $xi$ and $Y$ will take the value $yj$ is
written $p(X = xi, Y = yj)$ and is called the joint probability of $X = xi$ and
$Y = yj$. It is given by the number of points falling in the cell i,j as a fraction of the
total number of points, and hence

$$ p(X = x_i, Y = y_j) = \frac{n_{ij}}{N}$$

$$ p(X = x_i) = \frac{c_i}{N}

- sum rule of probability: $p(X = x_i) = \sum_{j=1}^L p(X = x_i, Y = y_j)$
  - Note that $p(X = x_i)$ is called the marginal probability because it is obtained by marginalizing or summing out the other variables (in this case Y)
