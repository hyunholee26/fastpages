## 1. [Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy): Sparse Machine Learning Models 5 Years Later!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxAn0oglMVw)
 [![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/NxAn0oglMVw/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxAn0oglMVw)
 - SINDy is a kind of solver to find equations governed dynamics by combining many terms sparsely. Also, he suggests 4~5 key questions to find the equation for dynamics in terms of data, combined terms, optimization, etc.

## 2. [Deep Learning to Discover Coordinates for Dynamics: Autoencoders & Physics Informed Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQkDgu-Qp0)
 [![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/KmQkDgu-Qp0/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQkDgu-Qp0)
 - He explain deep learning, especially deep autoencoder, to descover proper coordinate system for certain dynamics.
