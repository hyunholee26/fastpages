          "content": "Research Interests . Main research interests are below: . Deep learning for geospatial data such as remote sensed images and DEM (digital elevation model) | Spatiotemporal data mining and applications for water resources management | Spatial data science and geographic information science | . My research focuses on incorporating domain knowledge within data-driven models or learning process as an inductive bias, thereby achieving efficient learning from few samples or sparse observations and making the model easier to understand for scientists and non-machine-learning experts. Also, I would like to research the applications of these techniques in water resources management such as the prediction of water level and dam inflow.
