      My name is <b>Hyunho Lee</b> and I am a <b>Senior Manager at K-water</b> (Korea Water Resources Corporation) in Daejeon, South Korea. 
      <br><br>
      I am interested in machine learning problems in general. More specifically, <b>my research focuses on incorporating prior knowledge (especially physics-based knowledge) within data-driven models or learning process as an inductive bias, thereby achieving efficient learning from few samples or sparse observations</b>. Also, I would like to research the applications of these techniques in water resources management such as the prediction of water level and dam inflow.
