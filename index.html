My name is **Hyunho Lee** and I am a **Senior Manager at K-water** (Korea Water Resources Corporation) in Daejeon, South Korea. 

I am interested in machine learning problems in general. More specifically, <b>my research focuses on incorporating prior knowledge (especially physics-based knowledge) within data-driven models or learning process as an inductive bias, thereby achieving efficient learning from few samples or sparse observations</b>. Also, I would like to research the applications of these techniques in water resources management such as the prediction of water level and dam inflow. 

My main research interests are below:

 - Physics-guided machine learning
 - Spatiotemporal data mining (especially forecasting)
 - Uncertainty Estimation

For more information, please refer to "About Me".
